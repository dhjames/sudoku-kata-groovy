This project was done in order to practice TDD and other programming skills.
It is implemented
in Groovy and uses the Spock Framework for unit tests.

The goal was to write a program that tests whether a Sudoku puzzle has been
solved correctly. We want to write the simplest program that satisfies the
following conditions:

* A Sudoku table has 9 rows and 9 columns
* Cells in the table are allowed to have a value between between 1 and 9
* When a table is solved, each row, column, and 3 x 3 box also contain the values 1 - 9

To compile and run the tests, type:

 ./gradlew build

Gradle will automatically download the required dependencies.
